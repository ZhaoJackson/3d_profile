## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi there! 👋 I'm **Jackson Zhao**, a data scientist and AI researcher passionate about building innovative technologies that create meaningful social impact. I hold a Master's in Quantitative Methods from Columbia University and have worked with organizations like the United Nations on global AI-driven projects.

My passion is deeply rooted in mental health care 💙. I've developed machine-driven benchmarks to evaluate suicide prevention chatbots, fine-tuned language models for ethical alignment, and built pipelines that translate complex social data into actionable insights.
